# Tick_Behavior
This project investigates the questing behavior of _Ixodes pacificus_ nymphal ticks. This species of tick is the primary vector of Lyme disease in the western United States. This study focuses on how geographic origin influences tick activity under controlled conditions.

Ticks were observed across multiple trials, with movement data collected at 30-second intervals over 5-minute periods. The dataset includes behavioral metrics such as total distance, percent activity, and vertical movement, alongside biological factors like population origin and engorgement status.

This repository contains the data and other neccessary documents for investigating how geography may influence and shape host-seeking behaviors with implications for understanding disease risk and tick ecology.
