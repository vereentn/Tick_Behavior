## Dataset Overview

Title: Ixodes pacificus Questing Behavior Dataset

Description: This dataset contains observations of questing behavior in Ixodes pacificus nymphal ticks, focusing on vertical movement and activity levels. The data explores the influence of geographic origin on questing behavior across different locations in California.

Source: Data collected from controlled laboratory trials and field sampling in California.

Collection Process: Each tick was observed over a 5-minute trial, with movement recorded at 30-second intervals. The dataset includes multiple trials per tick and considers factors such as engorgement level, population origin, and infection status.

Bioinformatics: Raw movement and position data were used to calculate activity metrics, and data were organized into a tidy structure using R.

## Data Instances

This dataset can be used to analyze tick questing behavior in relation to geography and environmental conditions. It may inform public health strategies for vector-borne disease prevention.

## Rationale

This dataset was created to evaluate variation in tick behavior that could influence host encounters and pathogen transmission. Understanding behavioral differences by population origin and geographical differences helps inform ecological and public health research related to Lyme disease dynamics in California.

## Annotations

Data points and tick movement were documented every 30 seconds over the course of 3, 5-minute trials.

## Annotation Process

Raw tick movement was determined based on positional changes between time intervals.
All variables were calculated using formulas and programs in Excel and/or R script.

## Annotator

Data from behavioral experimentations and field samples were conducted by Timara Vereen, a current master's student in Dr. Andrea Swei's Lab at SFSU.

## Personal and Sensitive Information

This dataset contains no personal information.

## Social Impact of Dataset

This dataset contributes to ecological understanding of tick behavior and Lyme disease transmission risk.

## Discussion of Biases

Trials were conducted in a lab setting and doesn't mimic a natural host-seeking behavior.

There were high reports of inactive ticks which skewed activity measures.

Sampling locations were limited within this study and may not reflect the full geographic range and their influence.

## Other Limitations

Nymphal ticks were tested during this project, however, behavior may differ in larvae or adults tick life stages.
